### About Me
Ever since my parents brought home our first family PC way back in the year 2000, it has been my dream to become a computer programmer. Now, I'm finally on my way to making it happen. Upward and onward! :muscle: :triumph:<br>

There will be something <s>vaguely interesting</s> really cool here soon. Promise.
